# Camera System Shot Selection - Implementation Complete

## Summary

I've successfully implemented comprehensive shot selection functionality for your Unity camera system. The system now provides intuitive tools for navigating, previewing, and testing individual camera shots within your sequences.

## What's Been Added

### üéØ Core Shot Selection Features
- **Shot Navigation**: Next/Previous shot selection with wraparound
- **Direct Selection**: Select specific shots by index
- **Visual Highlighting**: Selected shots appear with enhanced visual feedback
- **Isolation Mode**: Show only selected shot to focus on individual setup
- **Preview System**: Test individual shots without running full sequence

### üì± Inspector Controls
- **Selection Fields**: `selectedShotIndex`, `highlightSelectedShot`, `showOnlySelectedShot`
- **Context Menu Commands**: Right-click for quick navigation and preview
- **Custom Editor**: Enhanced inspector with navigation buttons and keyboard shortcuts
- **Quick Selection Dropdown**: Jump to any shot by name

### üé® Visual Feedback System
- **Enhanced Gizmos**: Selected shots are 1.3x larger with brighter colors
- **Selection Indicators**: White outline rings around selected shots
- **Playing Shot Indication**: Yellow tint for currently executing shots
- **Information Labels**: Detailed shot info displayed in Scene view
- **Camera Visualization**: Frustum, look directions, and target connections

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Page Up/Down**: Navigate through shots
- **Space**: Preview selected shot (in edit mode)
- **Enter**: Jump camera to selected shot position

## Files Created/Modified

### Modified Files
- **`CameraSystem.cs`**: Added shot selection core functionality
- **`CameraShot.cs`**: Already had necessary structure for selection

### New Files
- **`Editor/CameraSystemEditor.cs`**: Custom inspector with navigation controls
- **`CameraSystemTester.cs`**: Comprehensive testing script
- **`ShotSelectionGuide.md`**: Complete usage documentation

### Documentation
- **`ShotSelectionGuide.md`**: Detailed user guide with examples
- **`InspectorFieldGuide.md`**: Still valid for conditional fields
- **`RotationSystemGuide.md`**: Still valid for rotation system
- **`GizmoVisualizationGuide.md`**: Still valid for gizmo system

## How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. **Select a shot**: Set `selectedShotIndex` in inspector or use navigation buttons
2. **Enable highlighting**: Check `highlightSelectedShot` for visual feedback
3. **Navigate shots**: Use "Select Next/Previous Shot" context menu or Page Up/Down keys
4. **Preview shots**: Use "Preview Selected Shot" or Space key
5. **Jump to position**: Use "Jump to Selected Shot" or Enter key

### Advanced Workflow
1. **Planning**: Use selection to navigate and plan your shot sequence
2. **Setup**: Enable `showOnlySelectedShot` to focus on individual shots
3. **Testing**: Preview individual shots before running full sequence  
4. **Refinement**: Compare shots by jumping between them

### Testing the System
1. Add `CameraSystemTester` script to a GameObject
2. Assign your `CameraSystem` to the tester
3. Use "Run All Tests" context menu to validate functionality
4. Use "Demo Shot Selection" to see the system in action

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Smart Selection Management
```csharp
// Automatic wraparound navigation
cameraSystem.SelectNextShot();  // Wraps from last to first shot
cameraSystem.SelectPreviousShot();  // Wraps from first to last shot

// Direct selection with validation
cameraSystem.SelectShot(2);  // Select shot at index 2
```

### Visual Feedback
- Selected shots appear with **brighter colors** and **larger markers**
- **Selection rings** clearly indicate which shot is active
- **Information labels** show shot details in Scene view
- **Isolation mode** hides other shots for focused editing

### Integration with Existing System
- Works seamlessly with existing shot execution
- Maintains all current gizmo and visualization features
- Compatible with all 9 shot types
- Preserves rotation system and conditional fields

## Testing & Validation

The system includes comprehensive testing:
- **Automated tests** for all selection functions
- **Navigation validation** including wraparound behavior
- **Visualization testing** for all gizmo features
- **Preview functionality** validation
- **Demo mode** for showcasing capabilities

## Next Steps

Your camera system is now complete with professional-grade shot selection capabilities! You can:

1. **Start using** the selection system to organize your shots
2. **Test individual shots** before creating full sequences
3. **Leverage keyboard shortcuts** for faster navigation
4. **Use isolation mode** when setting up complex shots
5. **Expand the system** with additional custom functionality as needed

The shot selection system provides intuitive tools that make it easy to manage complex camera sequences, test individual shots, and create polished cinematic experiences in Unity.
